# Notifications v1 — `org.wingman.nstack.notifications`

Tower is the authority. NStack advertises the capability (`notifications.inbox.v1`
in `GET /.well-known/nstack.json` and `notifications.inbox_v1` in the workspace
descriptor); it is not a separate service. A notification is a **durable,
actor-private, per-workspace inbox item** shared by every consuming application.
OS push is an optional transport and is **not part of this release** (see
"Implemented / not implemented").

Base: `/api/v4/flightdeck-pg/workspaces/{workspaceId}`. Every route needs NIP-98 and
active workspace membership. Responses are `Cache-Control: private, no-store`.
Bodies ≤ 16 KiB; unknown body fields are rejected (`400 validation_error`).
Errors use the Flight Deck PG shape
`{ "error": "<message>", "code": "<code>", "status": <n>, "identity": {...}, ... }`.
Actor identity comes only from NIP-98; there is no actor override. `app_npub`
is **not** an application discriminator. `source_app_id` (producer) and
`client_app_id` (consumer) are separate identifiers.

## Item — `org.wingman.notification.item` v1

```json
{
  "schema": "org.wingman.notification.item", "version": 1,
  "id": "uuid", "workspace_id": "uuid", "recipient_actor_id": "uuid",
  "change_seq": 12, "row_version": 3,
  "source": { "app_id": "flightdeck.core", "label": "Flight Deck", "kind": "tower_rule" },
  "category": "mention",
  "reasons": ["mention", "chat_thread"],
  "severity": "low|normal|high|critical",
  "status": "active|resolved",
  "origin": "live",
  "group": { "key": "mention:thread:<id>:w<window>", "event_count": 2 } ,
  "actor": { "actor_id": "uuid|null", "display_name": "Rick|null", "kind": "human|agent|app|service|null" },
  "subject": { "kind": "thread|channel|task|doc|app_object|workspace", "scope_id": null, "channel_id": null,
               "thread_id": null, "task_id": null, "doc_id": null, "message_id": null, "comment_id": null,
               "activity_version": null },
  "presentation": { "title": "Rick mentioned you", "body": "Thread title", "icon": "mention", "push_preview": "generic" },
  "action": { "type": "open", "target": { "kind": "thread", "channel_id": "…", "thread_id": "…", "message_id": "…" } },
  "audience": { "client_apps": ["*"] },
  "occurred_at": "ISO", "updated_at": "ISO", "expires_at": "ISO|null",
  "state": { "read": false, "read_at": null, "read_reason": null, "dismissed": false, "archived": false },
  "access": "ok"
}
```

* `reasons` lists every rule that selected the recipient. `category` is the highest
  precedence reason: `security > approval > dm > mention > task_assignment >
  comment_tag > chat_thread`. One source event yields **at most one item per recipient**.
* `read_reason`: `user | bulk | subject_viewed | already_viewed | resolved | null`.
* Unknown `subject.kind`/`target.kind`/future `version` ⇒ clients render a generic
  card and never crash. `action.target` is a typed target, never a path or URL.
* `access:"unavailable"` appears only on `GET items/{id}` (presentation replaced by
  `{"title":"Item no longer available","body":""}`, `action:null`); lists never contain
  inaccessible items. `icon` is a hint. Presentation text for `app_object` subjects is
  always a registry generic template (`title` = source label, `body` = category label).
* A **tombstone** (in `changes` only) is content-free:
  `{ "schema":"org.wingman.notification.tombstone","version":1,"id","workspace_id","change_seq","change_type":"remove","removal_reason":"access_lost|subject_deleted|withdrawn|source_revoked|expired" }`.

Core categories (`flightdeck.core`, built in): `chat_thread`, `mention`, `dm`,
`comment_tag`, `task_assignment`. Inbox defaults on for all; alert defaults
(stored for future delivery) on except `chat_thread`.

### Folding

A new event folds into the recipient's **open** item (unread, not dismissed or archived)
with the same `group.key`; otherwise a new item is created. Fold increments
`event_count`, sets `subject.activity_version = max(...)`, refreshes presentation, bumps
**`row_version` and `change_seq`**. Read/dismissed/archived items are never mutated by a
new event. Group keys: `chat_thread:thread:<id>` / `chat_thread:channel:<id>`;
`mention:thread:<id>:w<n>` where `n = floor(occurred_epoch/600)` (10-minute window);
`mention`/`comment_tag`/`task_assignment` on tasks/docs `:<kind>:<id>`; `dm:thread|channel:<id>`.

**Folding identity** is `(source, group_key, canonical audience set)`: an event never folds
into an open item whose `audience.client_apps` differs (a different audience yields a separate
item). Otherwise a client-app-filtered change feed could keep a previously visible item stale
when the audience changes without a tombstone. An open `task_assignment` item for a task
absorbs further assignment events for that task (explicit assign route and task metadata both
announce one assignment) without incrementing `event_count`.

## Multi-app view (`client_app_id`, v1.1)

`client_app_id=<slug>` is a **presentation filter, never access authority**. It is accepted
on `GET items`, `GET counts`, `GET changes` and as `selector.client_app_id` on `POST bulk`
(slug `^[a-z][a-z0-9_.-]{0,63}$`; `*` is not a client). Omitted ⇒ no app filtering.

An item is *visible to client C* iff `'*' ∈ audience.client_apps` **or** `C ∈ audience.client_apps`,
**and** the effective `inbox` rule for `(source, category, C)` is not `off`. Effective rule: most
specific key wins, level order `(src,cat) > (src,*) > (*,cat) > (*,*)`; within a level a rule with
`client_app_id=C` beats `client_app_id='*'`; `mode:"default"` rows are ignored (inherit). The
same SQL predicate drives list, counts, badge, changes and bulk, so list == count.

Item projection (creation) honours only `client_app_id='*'` rules because the item is shared. A rule with
`client_app_id=C, channel=inbox, mode=off` hides the item from C's views only; it never deletes, reads or
tombstones the shared item, other apps still see it, and read state stays shared (one `row_version`).
`badge` = visible-to-C, unread, severity ≥ normal (with no `client_app_id`: shared-audience items).

### Convergence: `rules_revision`
Every recipient has a `rules_revision` (integer, starts 0) bumped in the transaction of **every** rules
write (`PUT rules` and the legacy preference mirror). It is returned by `GET rules`, `GET items`, `GET counts`
and `GET changes`. A client keeps the value current at snapshot time and sends
`changes?after_seq=N&rules_revision=R`. If `R` ≠ current ⇒ `410 {"code":"reset_required","reason":"rules_changed","head_seq","rules_revision"}`:
redo snapshot-then-replay with the new value and re-fetch rules. Clients that do not send it must re-snapshot
whenever the `rules_revision` of any response changes.

## Consumer routes

### `GET /notifications/items`
Query: `view=inbox|unread|archived|dismissed|all` (default `inbox`), `category`,
`source_app_id`, `client_app_id`, `limit` (1–100, default 50), `cursor`. Unknown query ⇒ 400.
Newest-first (`occurred_at DESC, id DESC`).
```json
{ "identity": {…}, "items": [Item], "next_cursor": "opaque|null",
  "head_seq": 4815, "rules_revision": 3, "counts": { "unread_total": 7, "capped_at": 999 },
  "inbox_started_at": "ISO" }
```
`head_seq`, `rules_revision`, the page and `counts` are read in one snapshot. Cursor is opaque, HMAC-bound to
`(workspace, actor, route, filters)`, 7-day expiry; malformed/mismatched ⇒ `400 invalid_cursor`.
`view=inbox` = not removed/dismissed/archived. `unread` = inbox ∧ active ∧ unread.

### `GET /notifications/items/{id}`
`{ "identity", "item": Item }`. Another actor's / workspace's id ⇒ `404 notification_not_found`.
Tombstoned ⇒ `{ "item": <tombstone> }` with status 200.

### `GET /notifications/changes?after_seq=N&limit=200&client_app_id=&rules_revision=`
Ascending per-recipient `change_seq`, limit ≤ 200 (default 200).
```json
{ "identity": {…}, "changes": [Item | Tombstone], "through_seq": 4820, "head_seq": 4830, "rules_revision": 3, "has_more": true }
```
`through_seq` is the last returned row's `change_seq` when `has_more`, otherwise `head_seq`
(floor, head, `rules_revision` and rows are read in one `REPEATABLE READ` snapshot), so a page whose rows
were all filtered out by `client_app_id` still advances. With `client_app_id`, live items not visible to
that client are omitted; tombstones (content-free) are always included. `changes` returns **every** transition (any
partition) including dismissed/archived state flags; items entering a non-hydrated
partition may be ignored by clients (advance `local_seq` regardless). Each entry carries the
item's latest state; an item changed twice appears once (at its latest `change_seq`).
Items that became inaccessible between sweeps are tombstoned **before** the response is built.
`410 reset_required` (`code:"reset_required"`, `reason: "rules_changed" | "tombstone_floor" | "ahead"`,
plus `head_seq`, `rules_revision`) when `rules_revision` is supplied and stale, `after_seq` is below the
recipient's `tombstone_floor_seq`, or `after_seq` is above `head_seq`: redo cold start.

**Cold start (snapshot-then-replay):** page `items?view=inbox` until `next_cursor:null`
keeping `S = head_seq` of the **first** page; then `changes?after_seq=S` until
`has_more:false`, applying idempotently by `(id, change_seq)`. Set `local_seq` to the
last applied `through_seq`. Steady state: SSE hint → `changes?after_seq=local_seq`.

### `GET /notifications/counts?installation_id=&client_app_id=`
```json
{ "identity", "unread_total": 7, "by_category": {"mention":2}, "by_source_app": {"flightdeck.core":7},
  "badge": 3, "capped_at": 999, "head_seq": 4820, "rules_revision": 3, "inbox_started_at": "ISO" }
```
Same visibility predicate as `items` (list == count under revocation and under `client_app_id`).
`unread_total`, `by_category`, `by_source_app` count active, unread, not dismissed/archived/removed
items visible to the client app. `badge` = those with severity ≥ normal (see Multi-app view).
`installation_id` is accepted and ignored (installation registry is not implemented). Counts cap at 999.

### `PATCH /notifications/items/{id}`
```json
{ "mutation_id": "uuid", "expected_row_version": 3, "patch": { "read": true, "dismissed": false, "archived": false } }
```
`patch` has ≥1 of `read|dismissed|archived` (booleans). `dismissed:true` and `archived:true`
also set read (`read_reason` kept if already read else `user`). `read:false` clears `read_at`.
Optional `observed_change_seq`: if present and `< item.change_seq` ⇒ 409 `state_conflict`.
`200 { "item": Item }` with new `row_version`/`change_seq`.
`409 state_conflict { "item": Item }` (stale `expected_row_version`). Read/dismiss/archive are
observation-sensitive: the client must use the rendered `row_version` and its observed `change_seq`, and on 409 adopt the
returned newer item and show it, without auto-acknowledging or re-folding the intent onto it. Only restoring visibility
(unread/undismiss/unarchive) may rebase onto the new item, using a **new** `mutation_id`. `409 mutation_id_reused` when the same
`mutation_id` is sent with a different request; an identical retry returns the
original acknowledgement (replay-safe). `404 notification_not_found`. A no-op
patch (state already as requested) succeeds without bumping versions.

### `POST /notifications/bulk`
```json
{ "mutation_id":"uuid", "op":"mark_read|mark_unread|dismiss|archive|unarchive",
  "selector": { "ids":["uuid", …≤200] } }
{ "mutation_id":"uuid", "op":"mark_read", "selector": { "up_to_seq": 4815, "view":"inbox|unread|…", "category":"mention", "source_app_id":"…", "client_app_id":"…" } }
```
With `selector.client_app_id` only items visible to that client are touched.
`up_to_seq` applies only to items with `change_seq <= up_to_seq` at execution; newer
(concurrently folded/created) items stay untouched. Capped at 5000 rows. Response
`{ "identity", "affected": n, "through_seq": head_after, "mutation_id" }`; same-`mutation_id`
retry returns the stored response.

### `GET /notifications/categories`
`{ "identity", "sources":[{ "app_id","label","kind", "categories":[{ "category","label","default_severity","default_inbox","default_alert","mandatory","grouping" }] }] }`
Includes `flightdeck.core` plus active workspace sources.

### `GET /notifications/rules`, `PUT /notifications/rules`
Preference rules for the caller in this workspace. Rule key
`(source_app_id, category, client_app_id, channel)`; `*` is a wildcard for the first three;
`channel` is `inbox|alert`; `mode` is `on|off|default`; `preview` (`generic|sender|full`, alert only).
```json
GET → { "identity", "rules":[{ "source_app_id":"flightdeck.core","category":"mention","client_app_id":"*","channel":"inbox","mode":"off","preview":null,"row_version":2 }], "rules_revision": 3 }
PUT { "mutation_id":"uuid", "rules":[ {…key, "mode":"off|on|default", "preview":null, "expected_row_version": 2} , …≤50 ] }
  → 200 { "identity", "rules":[…all…], "rules_revision": 4 }
```
**Per-key compare-and-swap, all or nothing (no last-writer-wins).** `expected_row_version` is required per
rule: the `row_version` of the same key in the last `GET` (`0` if the key was absent). A key may appear once per request.
`mode:"default"` means *inherit*: Tower keeps a **versioned row** (its `row_version` still increments, it is never
physically deleted) that resolves exactly like an absent rule, so a stale `expected_row_version: 0` can never
resurrect an overridden value. `default` needs an existing rule (`expected_row_version ≥ 1`, else `400`).

If any key is stale ⇒ `409 { "code":"rules_conflict", "conflicts":[{ source_app_id, category, client_app_id, channel,
expected_row_version, "current": Rule|null }], "rules":[all current], "rules_revision" }` and **nothing is written**; the
client adopts the returned `rules` (shown with a notice) and the user explicitly retries, which sends a **new** `mutation_id`. An identical retry of a successful PUT
(hash includes expected versions) returns the stored 200; the same `mutation_id` with a different body ⇒
`409 mutation_id_reused` (a semantic rejection, not a retry).

`inbox:off` with `client_app_id:"*"` stops item creation for that recipient (and hides existing matching items from
every client view); `client_app_id:"<app>"` hides only that app's view (see Multi-app view). **Mandatory** categories ignore
`off`. The `alert` channel is stored and returned but there is no alert sender yet. Legacy booleans
(`chat_threads_enabled`…) are mirrored as `alert` rules for `flightdeck.core` in both directions; a PUT of `default`
on a core alert rule restores that category's registry default. `PATCH /notifications/preferences` writes the legacy
booleans, the mirrored alert rules (bumping their `row_version`) and `rules_revision` in **one transaction**, so a
client holding a stale `row_version` gets `rules_conflict` and refetches.

## Core event sources (Tower rules)

Captured transactionally from the outbox: `message.created/revised` (structured `mentions` /
`newly_added_mentions`), `task_comment.created`, `doc_comment.created` (carries its own `mentions`),
`task_assignment.assigned`, **`task.created`** (metadata `assigned_to_npub` ⇒ `task_assignment`; canonical
`mentions` ⇒ `mention`), **`task.updated`** (assignee only when `assignment.previous_npub ≠ current_npub`, an
emitter field added with this contract; mentions only `current − previous`) and **`document_mention_added`**
(document *body* mentions ⇒ `mention`, family `doc`). `document_comment_mention_added` is deliberately **not**
captured (it duplicates `doc_comment.created`). Recipients come only from structured payloads; ACL is rechecked live;
a text-only edit with no newly added mention yields no item. Tombstones also scrub `trigger_actor_id`,
`group_key`, `reasons`, `resource_id` and ACL columns. `withdraw` tombstones a whole folded item (v1 limit).

## Realtime hint

For each item change Tower writes an actor-private event on the existing
`events/stream`: `event_type:"flightdeck_pg.notification_item.changed"`,
`entity_type:"notification_item"`, `entity_id:<item id>`,
`payload:{ "recipient_actor_id", "change_seq", "operation":"created|updated|state|removed" }`.
**No title/body.** Treat as "call `changes?after_seq=local_seq` now". It is a hint
(cursor/ordering are not authoritative); managed/delegated audiences never receive it.

## Resource view bridge

* Inbox state **never** writes resource view state (read/dismiss/archive of an item does not mark the resource viewed).
* A resource-view write that advances `viewed_activity_version` to **W** (observed value the client
  rendered, not the head) marks read (`read_reason:"subject_viewed"`) every active unread item whose
  subject resolves to that resource and `subject.activity_version <= W`. Newer activity stays unread.
* Events whose `subject.activity_version <= viewed` at projection time are created already read
  (`read_reason:"already_viewed"`). The watermark is read **after** taking the recipient lock that the bridge
  also takes, so a view commit concurrent with projection can neither leave the new item unread when it was
  already viewed nor mark it read when the viewed version is lower.
* Feed item state and wapp activity are independent of inbox state.

## Producer routes (external apps)

Producer identity is the NIP-98 signer bound to a workspace-registered source. `source_app_id`
is **derived** from the binding; a body `source_app_id` must equal it (else `403 source_mismatch`).
`flightdeck.core` and `mandatory` categories are refused (`403 reserved_source`).

```
GET  /notification-producers/grants/me
POST /notification-events                       201 accepted | 200 replayed
GET  /notification-events/{eventId}             producer-visible status (own events)
POST /notification-events/{eventId}/withdraw
```
Event body (`org.wingman.notification.event` v1):
```json
{ "schema":"org.wingman.notification.event","version":1,
  "event_key":"<1-128 [A-Za-z0-9:_.-]>", "op":"publish|resolve|withdraw",
  "category":"capture_delivery_failed", "severity":"low|normal|high",
  "occurred_at":"ISO", "subject":{"kind":"app_object","app_id":"blinkers","object_type":"capture","object_id":"…"},
  "recipients":{"mode":"actors","actor_ids":["uuid"]},
  "audience":{"client_apps":["*"]}, "group_key":"capture:7c1e", "target_event_key":"<for withdraw>",
  "action":{"type":"open","target":{"kind":"app_object","app_id":"blinkers","object_type":"capture","object_id":"…"}},
  "expires_at":"ISO" }
```
Only `app_object` (and `workspace`) subjects are accepted from external producers in v1.
Presentation is always the registry generic template (extra producer text is dropped; response has
`presentation_downgraded:true` if `presentation`/`title`/`body` were supplied). Recipients must be
active workspace members **and** inside the grant's `allowed_recipient_mode`
(`actor_list` ⊆ `allowed_recipient_actor_ids`, or `owner_only`). Same `event_key`+same canonical hash ⇒
`200 replayed`; different hash ⇒ `409 event_key_reused`. `resolve` marks the source's open items with the
same `group_key` resolved+read (no alert); `withdraw` (`target_event_key`) tombstones items created from that
event. Errors: `403 category_not_granted | recipient_not_allowed | source_mismatch | reserved_source |
source_not_active`, `413 payload_too_large`, `429 rate_limited` (Retry-After).
Response: `{ "event": { "id","state":"accepted","event_key" }, "replayed": false, "recipient_count"? }` —
never per-recipient detail. Producers cannot read any inbox.

Source lifecycle (effective `workspace.manage` only, via `authorizeFlightDeckPgOperation`; direct/group/role
grants count, a bare owner/admin role does not; denial is the Flight Deck PG `403 permission_denied` with
`required_permission:"workspace.manage"`; there is no owner/admin fallback):
```
GET  /notification-sources                     PUT /notification-sources/{sourceAppId}
POST /notification-sources/{id}/disable        POST /notification-sources/{id}/revoke
GET  /admin/notifications/queue                (workspace.manage: depth, oldest age, dead count)
```
`PUT` body: `{ "kind":"agent|app|wapp_installation", "display_name", "producer_signer_npub", "allowed_categories":[{"category","label","default_severity","grouping"}], "allowed_recipient_mode":"actor_list|owner_only", "allowed_recipient_actor_ids":[…], "max_severity", "rate_per_minute", "allowed_client_apps":["*"] }`.
`allowed_recipient_actor_ids` must all be workspace members (`400 recipient_not_member`).
`revoke` stops new events immediately and tombstones the source's existing items (`source_revoked`).

## Legacy compatibility

`/notifications/{config,settings,preferences,subscriptions,deliveries}` and the
Web Push sender are unchanged in shape. Hardening: `POST …/evaluate` now rejects event ids from
another workspace (`404 event_not_found`) and requires effective `workspace.manage`; push
subscription upsert refuses to re-bind an endpoint owned by another actor (`409 transport_owned`).

## Implemented / not implemented in this release

Implemented: everything above. **Not implemented (404/absent, deliberately):** alert worker and
transports (Web Push migration, APNs, FCM), installation/transport registry
(`/me/notifications/installations…`), quiet hours (`/me/notifications/quiet-hours`),
subject mutes, entitlement leases (`acl_mode` is always `metadata_only`), silent baseline
import (inbox starts empty at activation; `inbox_started_at` reports when), record-subject
external events, scoped WApp inbox grants, delegated agent inbox read. Clients must treat
these as `backend-not-supported` and keep in-app notifications fully functional.

## Retention (defaults applied by the maintenance worker)

Read/dismissed/resolved items purged 90 days after last update; unread low/normal expire
after 180 days (tombstoned `expired`); high/critical after 365; archived after 2 years; tombstones
kept 30 days then `tombstone_floor_seq` advances (older cursors get `410 reset_required`); events 180
days; intake `done` rows 14 days.

## Delivery guarantees

At-least-once projection with idempotent receipts `(event, recipient)`; no exactly-once
promise for any transport. `change_seq` is allocated under a per-recipient row lock, so sequence
order equals commit order for that recipient. Canonical lock order for every writer of a recipient's inbox:
mutation advisory lock → recipient cursor lock (`flightdeck_pg_notification_lock_recipient`) → item rows (by id) →
`next_seq`; multi-recipient writers (resolve, withdraw, source revoke, maintenance, projection pages) lock
recipients ascending, so item PATCH/bulk/view-bridge/projection/tombstone cannot deadlock.

### Personal channel mentions-only mode

`GET /workspaces/:workspaceId/notifications/channel-preferences` returns the verified
caller's `{channel_preferences: [{channel_id, mode, row_version}], rules_revision}`.
The list contains readable non-DM channels with saved preferences. An absent row
means `all`. Preferences belong to the workspace actor, not the installation or app.

`PUT /workspaces/:workspaceId/notifications/channel-preferences/:channelId` requires
`channel.read`, with `{mode: "mentions_only" | "all", expected_row_version: 0 | n}`.
Use the exact saved row version, or 0 when absent. A stale write returns 409
`channel_preference_conflict` and the current complete preference list/revision;
nothing is written. Successful writes return the same shape as GET. An `all` row
is kept and versioned so a stale device cannot resurrect a prior mute. DMs reject
this operation and retain their separate category setting.

`mentions_only` suppresses ordinary `flightdeck.core/chat_thread` activity at
projection, legacy Web Push eligibility, APNs enqueue and APNs pre-send recheck.
Direct mentions and comment tags derive from structured recipient identities;
DMs, task assignments, external app notifications and other category/app rules
keep their existing behavior. Current built-in task/doc comments notify only
directly tagged recipients, so have no ordinary comment category to suppress.

The same channel predicate filters list, counts, changes, direct item lookup and
bulk selection, including ordinary items created before the channel was muted.
Muting never marks content or notifications read, deletes messages, or changes
category preferences. Changes increment the existing recipient `rules_revision`;
clients must perform the existing snapshot reset to remove hidden cached entries
and update bell counts across devices. Newly muted events are not projected and
are not backfilled on unmute; future ordinary activity resumes. Previously saved
items are only hidden by the preference, so may appear again on unmute.
